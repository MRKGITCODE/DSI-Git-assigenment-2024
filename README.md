a. What is an issue?

An issue is a feature or bug tracking tool used in software development. It's essentially a note on a Github repository used to communicate about improvements, tasks, or problems related to the project. Issues can be opened, assigned, and closed by contributors.

b. What is a pull request?

A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a repository hosted on platforms like GitHub. It allows contributors to notify others about changes they've pushed to a branch in a repository. Others can review the changes, discuss potential modifications, and finally merge the changes into the main branch if they are deemed appropriate.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?

Navigate to the repository on GitHub. Go to the "Pull Requests" tab and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Select the branch with your changes from the "Compare" dropdown menu and review your changes.

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)

Navigate to the repository on GitHub. Click on the "Settings" tab. In the left sidebar, click on "Collaborators.". In "Manage access", click on green "Add people" button and enter the Github username of the person you want to invite. Choose Write access level to allow the collaborator to push changes to the repository.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. While Git is the tool that manages the version control locally on your computer, GitHub provides a platform for hosting repositories online, collaboration, and additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools.

f. What does git diff do?

git diff is a Git command that shows the differences between two commits, the working directory and the index, or between two branches. It displays the line-by-line differences in the content of files that have been changed or modified.

g. What is the main branch?

The main branch is typically the default branch in a Git repository where the latest stable version of the project is kept. It's often named "main," "master," or "trunk." This branch usually represents the official project history and is where development work is merged after being tested and approved.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

It's generally not recommended to push changes directly to the main branch, especially in collaborative environments. Instead, it's better to work on separate branches for each feature or bug fix, push those branches to the repository, and then create pull requests for review and integration into the main branch. This helps maintain a clean and organized version history and allows for proper code review before merging changes into the main branch.
